<!--    description 

        this file contains the boards mounted on the robot grouped by body parts.
        every <board> has two compulsory properties: type, name. it may also have an 
        additional property: required. so far the only value of required is "version".
        each <board> contains two compulsory fields: ondevice, ataddress. and it may
        have an additional field: version (if there is the required="version" property).
        here is description of each of the previous:
        -   type: must have a valid board name in short format: ems4, mc4plus, foc, strain, 
            strain2, mtb, mtb4, mais, mc4, etc.
        -   name: can be any string.
        -   required: if present can be only ="version". it tells that that board MUST match
            a given version of firmware. it is used to identify amongst the many versions of mc4 
            boards.
        -   ondevice: tells on which device the board is located. it can be ETH (for ETH robots)
            or CFW2 for first generation CAN robots. 
        -   ataddress: contains the network address under device. if device is ETH there is
            ip="10.0.1.x" and if the board is a CAN board there is also canbus="c" canadr="a".
            if the device is CFW, then there is only canbus="c" canadr="a".
         -  version: contains the required version. typically only major and mino values are specified.
         
        the aim of this files is to be parsed by the python program robotFWmanager.py
